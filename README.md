# Emerald Legacy Damage Calculator

![Test Status](https://github.com/nikerain/el-damage-calc/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

This is the Damage calculator for the Pokémon Emerald RomHack [Emerald Legacy][0], created by [SmithPlaysPokemon][1].

It is a fork of [smogon/damage-calc][2], so for any questions referring to the original code, refer to its [`README.md`][3]!
I have altered the mechanics, moves and Pokémon to work as they do in Emerald Legacy, as well as added all the sets of Emerald Legacy's Battle Facility Pokémon.

The layout was visually inspired by the [Battle Tree Damage Calculator][4] and the [Pokémon Run and Bun Damage Calculator][5]. If any future people looking to fork smogon/damage-calc[0] come across my fork, feel free to look, but please believe that I have no idea how this actually works.
